# Marios Pizza Parlor
### By Brevin Cronk

## Description
### Marios Pizza Parlor is a webpage I created for our prototypes and constructors portion of our intermediate JavaScript course. You are able to pick out toppings and sizes for your pizza and the price caries depending on the size.

## Specifications:
### Takes the input of the topping checkboxes, pushes them into an array, turns the array into text, and displays the text.
* ### Input: Pepperoni: Checked, Olives: Checked, Chicken : Unchecked.
* ### Output "Toppings: Pepperoni, Chicken
### Price varies depending on pizza size with a simple formula.
* ### Input: 12 Inch,
* ### Output: Price is 12 Dollars. 18 inch would be 15 dollars.

## Known Bugs
### So far I am unable to make it so you can pick multiple toppings. It only works with 1 topping. Will correct soon.
